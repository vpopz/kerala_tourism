                beautiful waterfalls, which makes its way down from a height of 300 feet, through the dense tropical forest of 
                Kollam. The term Palaruvi, literally means "Stream of Milk" in Malayalam and forms a stunning backdrop of 
                milk-white burst of foam, the sound of which resounds through the otherwise peaceful virgin forests of Kollam. 
                This amazing destination is surrounded by lush green valleys and natural herbal groves, which apparently makes 
                this waterfall, rich in medicinal properties. A lot of tourists visit this spectacular sight to take bath under 
                the waterfall and get benefited with amazing Ayurvedic properties</p>
